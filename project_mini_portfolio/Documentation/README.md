## What Was Used?
The skeleton framework is the platform my portfolio is standing on, and there isn't much there past what we did in class with the skeleton demo. I did not implement any of the recommended tutorials' methods into my portfolio. 

## How Was It Altered?
Quite a bit of stylings changed. Colors, fonts, font-sizes, and while it still holds the main layout of the skeleton demo, I feel I have put a bit of a personal spin of the website.

## What Else Is There?
I spent a lot of my time trying to create and debug a multi-gallery image gallery that, within one page, there could exist mulitple "image panes" that could each cycle through their own subset of images. The plan was to have one image gallery per project. Long story short, much time was lost. So instead, I expanded the Image Gallery Homework and implemente it into my portfolio.
