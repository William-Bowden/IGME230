                <h4>PhysicsJS was a Game Changer... literally</h4>
                <p>The game was changed from <strong><em>Slinger</em></strong> to <strong><em>Blobby</em></strong> after encountering issues with integrating PixiJS with PhysicsJS. There were rendering issues that I couldn't solve on my own or find any documentation about. After spending a few hours over the course of a couple of days, the descision was made to alter the game. Without a physics engine, I was forced to change the game quite a bit. But I am more than happy with what the game is becoming and the feeling of what I've made, as there is still a "physics-y" feeling.</p>
