					Obstsacles faced and how they were overcome
				</p>
                
                <h4>PhysicsJS was a Game Changer... literally</h4>
                <p>The game was changed from <strong><em>Slinger</em></strong> to <strong><em>Blobby</em></strong> after encountering issues with integrating PixiJS with PhysicsJS. There were rendering issues that I couldn't solve on my own or find any documentation about. After spending a few hours over the course of a couple of days, the descision was made to alter the game. Without a physics engine, I was forced to change the game quite a bit. But I am more than happy with what the game is becoming and the feeling of what I've made, as there is still a "physics-y" feeling.</p>
                
                <h4>Running into a Wall</h4>
				
				<p>When implementing walls (red platforms), I encountered a problem where I couldn't get them to be <b>solid</b>; the player could get through them sometimes. I tried everything. When I finally thought I had the solution, which at the time was just adding a vector to the player position that represented the movement from the center of the wall to where the player would be if it were pushed "straight out" from the center of the wall from whereever the player was. But for some reason my coordinates were off? Let's say the wall's Y coordinate was 60. When my player was above the wall the Y should be less than that of the wall but was larger? My player sitting on top of the wall with a Y coordinate of 60, had a Y coordinate of ~110. It was the same when below the wall, my player was apparently at y = ~140. So rather than having the wall be a solid object, it acts the same as any other platform except when the player attempts to jump up through it, the game calculates the future position of the player if they were to jump. This calculation is then checked to see if the player would/wouldn't be colliding with the wall anymore and allows the player through accordingly.</p>
				
                <h4>Who put those platforms there?</h4>
				
				<p>Pretty much from the start of platforms existing in my project, I was experiencing strange results when looking at exactly where my platforms were apparently located within the gamespace. When I was originally adding collision detection and I was looking for a way to push the player out of the wall objects in the game, I figured I would check the locations of both the wall and the player. With these two location I would calculate the vector pointing from the center of the wall to the center of the player and apply a force equal to that vector times the distance it would take to be outside of that wall. To my surprise, this ended with very strange results, so much so that I decided to look through the attributes of the platform in the inspector. It turns out, the platforms coordinates seemed to be <em>way off</em> from where it seems to be being displayed in the gamespace. Confused, I moved on to using a new way of dealing with these collisions. At first I thought it was being childed to an object that may have been sitting in the stage at an awkward position that I was just unaware about and couldn't figure out. It's like they were being randomized or something... oh... my platforms are randomly laid out when instantiated through the constructor. It wasn't until days later that I realized the platform's coordinate systems were being "set" when creating the platform. Setting a Pixi graphic's x and y coordinates within the constructor seemed to be setting up a new coordinate space in which the graphics will lay. The coordinate systems were always different and rather unpredictable. So to solve this, I made sure all of my objects are instantiated with x and y values of 0 <em>and then</em> when setting up the levels, each item is then randomly placed within the gamespace.</p>
				
				<h3>Resources Used</h3>
                
                <h4>Tools</h4>
                <p>I made all audio used within <em>Blobby</em> with some tools that can be found online for free. The music was created using the tool <a href=https://boscaceoil.net style="color: steelblue" target="_blank">Bosca Ceoil</a> and the sound effects using <a href=https://www.bfxr.net/ style="color: steelblue" target="_blank">bfxr</a>. </p>
				
				<h4>Help</h4>
                <p>I was able to use the code found in a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp" style="color: steelblue" target="_blank">w3Schools demo/tutorial</a> to create my volume slider.</p>
